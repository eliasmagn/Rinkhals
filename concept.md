# Project Concept

Rinkhals extends Anycubic's Kobra-series firmware with a curated Moonraker environment, OTA tooling, and application ecosystem so users can enjoy open-source printer workflows without giving up stock conveniences. The firmware layers community features—like Mainsail/Fluidd, custom scripts, and network tooling—on top of the vendor UI and services to create a hybrid experience that feels native to the printer.

This update adds the new **MMU Ace** Moonraker component. It plugs into the Kobra integration layer to broker MMU-specific GCode, request patching, and print metadata so multi-material workflows from Anycubic slicers and Fluidd can be synchronized with GoKlipper. Supporting this component aligns with the long-term concept of expanding hardware capabilities through software while preserving compatibility with vendor updates.
