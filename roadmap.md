# Roadmap

## Q2 2025
- âœ… Publish firmware documentation overview that connects boot flow, partitioning, and update research for contributors
- Finalize MMU Ace integration in Moonraker with dual-hub support, slicer tool-map ingestion, spool editing, endless-spool and selection bridging, plus dryer control validation on hardware
- Harden bed mesh calibration automation for KS1 and combo hardware
- Coordinate MMU Ace status widgets with Fluidd/Mainsail maintainers
- Polish Rinkhals UI diagnostics so printer customization warnings stay actionable and back them with regression tests (`pytest files/3-rinkhals/tests/test_ui_diagnostics.py`)

## Q3 2025
- Publish user-facing MMU configuration docs and troubleshooting guides informed by field feedback
- Surface MMU telemetry (gates, dryer, active filament) in the Rinkhals touch UI and remote dashboards

## Backlog
- Evaluate upstream Fluidd releases for native MMU widgets
- Explore automated regression tests for GoKlipper/Moonraker patches
